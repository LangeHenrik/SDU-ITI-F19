Hello! 

Quick note: the folder structure I had when working on this was (here using index as an example)

ITICloned/omhaw16/index.php

ITICloned/omhaw16/styling/style.css

ITICloned/omhaw16/registeruser.php

and so on...

meaning

the repo folder/my branch/index.php

Do keep note of this when opening the files, in case any issues arise, as I use this path multiple times throughout the project. 

In order to run it on your machines, you'd just have to alter the ITIProj / omhaw16 to wherever you place them, if you run into problems :)
