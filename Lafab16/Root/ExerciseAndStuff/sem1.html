		<h1> Autodesk Fusion</h1>
		We designed the griber in <i> Autodesk Fusion 360 </i> and simulated the functionallety to be sure it would work before printing it.
		The actuator (the boks with the spring) tended to get really warm when activated, therefore we made some airholes in the base. We also used the airholdes to fix the actuator with four splits.

		<h1> The circuit for the actuator</h1>
		We needed to design a circuit for the actuator. The actuator is a push/pull designed with a solenoid.
		When the actuator is activated the solenoid forms a magnetic field that pulls the split in and hold it.
		When the actuator is deavtiveted the spring will bring the split back to the "start position".

		<h1>Raspberry Pi</h1>
		We had the circuit in place. Now we just needed to write a program for the Raspberry Pi, to activate the circuit.
		We used C++ and began with a simple program just to turn on and off a red diode.

		<h1>The hole system in action</h1>
		When the program for the diode was in place we substituded the diode with the actuator-circuit.
		<br/> The program was written on the computer and transfered to the Raspberry.

		<h1> 3D-printing</h1>
		The griber being printed.
		<br/>
		The design made in <i> Autodesk Fusion</i> was saved as STL-files.
		We then used the STL-files to slice the griber in the 3D-printes software and convert it to G-code for the printer to use.
		The griber was printed with 3 shells and 20% infill.

		<h1>URCaps</h1>
		We developed a URCap to control the griber from Universal Robots own <i> Teachpend </i>.
		The URCap is written in UR's own language called <i>PolyScope</i>.
		<br/>
		We tranfered our URCap to the TeachPend, where the Raspberry was connected with a TCP (Transmission Control Protocol).
